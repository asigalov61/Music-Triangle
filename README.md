## Super-efficient and capable MIDI music AI encoding/tokenization strategy proposal

***

### Basic Concepts

1) Break down standard MIDI composition into pitches/time-shifts sequences

2) We only use pitches values and delta start-times to encode all music info

3) Once the model is created and output sequence is generated, music info is restored back by using a fuzzy music triangle ratio calculations
